	<p>By selecting to edit types, you will be presented with a window that is much like the image below. All fields that are marked with <font color="red">*</font> must be filled or selected, if you want to make a modification. If you do make a modification or delete a resource, changes will be present in the table, and in the list of resources in Main Window. If you delete a type, <font color="red">ALL</font> resources of that deleted type will be deleted. (Remember, a resource must have a type)<br/>
You can search for your types by their ID. Every change in earch will be registered, and you will see all types of that ID as you type in the search box.</br>
 All other fields can be empty or not selected. If you make a wrong entry, you will be forced to change it and will be promped with a message.</p>
